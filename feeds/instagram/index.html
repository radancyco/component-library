parameters: 

  - name: caption 
    note:

      - String
      - Optional

    desc:  "When set to <code>n</code>, the captions associated with each feed item will have a class of <code>visually-hidden</code> and <code>wai</code> appended to them. It will then be up to the front-end developer to accessibly hide this text from visual users, as they are still required to aid assistive technology users. Do <strong>not</strong> use <code>display: none</code> to hide these captions."

  - name: count 
    note:

      - Number
      - Optional

    desc: Sets the number of items to be displayed in the feed. The default is <strong>10</strong>.

  - name: default-css 
    note:

      - String
      - Optional

    desc:  When set to <code>y</code>, a link call to ready-made CSS will be appended to the <code>head</code> element of the page the script is running on. This is a bare-bones layout for quick implementation. Developers may wish to use their own CSS or copy over the default styles and alter as needed.

  - name: img 
    note:

      - String
      - Optional

    desc:  Determines which resolution of the image to be used. Accepted values include <code>low</code>, <code>high</code>, and <code>thumb</code>. The default is <code>thumb</code>, which will render thumbnail images.

  - name: user 
    note:

      - String
      - Mandatory

    desc:  Passing in the Instagram account name will display feed content from that account. Please note that this parameter will not work until the feed has been properly configured by the backend team.

notes: 

  - jQuery is a dependency for this feed to run successfully. Career Sites have jQuery built in, so this step is not necessary on that platform.

roadmap:

  - Maintenance - Revist markup. Consider using <code>figure</code> over a list, etc. (Low)
  - Maintenance - Refactor code to not depend on jQuery to function. (High) 
  - Logic - Have Bobby add logic to include "Sorry, no feed content is available. Please reach out to Radancy for support." (Medium)
