attributes:

  - name: data-tab-active
    html: .tab-accordion 
    note: 

      - Number
      - Optional

    desc: Use a number from "1" up to specify which tab or disclosure should be open on page load. When this attribute is not specified, the first panel will be open by default. A tab or disclosure must always have at least one panel open. Having all disclosures collapsed in smaller viewports is <strong>not currently supported</strong>.
  
  - name: data-tab-animation
    html: .tab-accordion 
    note: 

      - Boolean
      - Optional

    desc: Enables animation of the open content on page load and when tab or disclosure button is selected. You may customize the default CSS animation or keep what is currently in place.
  
  - name: data-tab-breakpoint
    html: .tab-accordion 
    note: 

      - String
      - Mandatory

    desc: Accepts any valid media query for more granular control over when interface needs to change from disclosure to tab and vice versa. Setting the breakpoint in code is important and allows us to pass in the needed roles and ARIA attributes for each interface type.
  
  - name: data-tab-callback
    html: .tab-accordion 
    note: 

      - String
      - Optional

    desc: Accepts a function name that will initiate on page load and when button is clicked or navigated to via arrow keys. The value of this data attribute should be the same as the function you wish to call.
  
  - name: data-tab-disable-url
    html: .tab-accordion 
    note: 

      - Boolean
      - Optional

    desc:  By default, the URL will always change to reflect selected page fragment. This is recommended behavior because it allows us to easily share content. If this behavior is not desired, you may use this attribute to disable this functionality.
  
  - name: data-tab-vertical
    html: .tab-accordion 
    note: 

      - Boolean
      - Optional

    desc: Changes the tab interface from horizontal, the default, to vertical. If buttons are moved to this position, keyboard arrow functionality will be reversed. Placement of tabs on the right side of the the content is <strong>not currently supported</strong>.
