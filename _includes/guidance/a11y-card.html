    <p>Including a card interface can significantly improve users' comprehension of the information at hand. Here are some important things to consider when designing and developing them, especially where accessibility is concerned.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Avoid linking multiple regions of card content (image, title, summary). Doing so creates more "noise" for assistive technology users to have to listen to. This is why linking the card title only, is always preferred. See the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/card/#pseudo-element-trick">pseudo-element trick</a> to learn how to make entire card region clickable.</li>
        <li>If images are present, use alt text only when the image requires a description. <strong>The card title must never be used as alt text.</strong></li>
        <li>Make sure your heading levels are based on surrounding content. These tend to be <code>h3</code> or <code>h2</code>. Skipping of headings should be avoided.</li>
        <li>Always use a class on your card headings in event heading level needs to be changed.</li>
        <li>If a summary is not present, <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/card/#card-no-summary">a heading must not be used</a>. Be sure to reflect this in your programming or if a request is made to remove a card summary.</li>
        <li>Be mindful of focus states. Applying <code>:focus</code> to <code>li</code> or <code>div</code> will not work for keyboard users. Use <code>:focus-within</code> instead.</li>
    </ul>
