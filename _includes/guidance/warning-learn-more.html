    <p>Consider alternatives to using "Learn More" or "Read More" or "View More" as CTAs within cards, as they pose accessibility challenges for screen reader users encountering identical linksm which can hinder usability. Instead, opt for friendly, unique, contextually relevant links for improved accessibility and if such a call to action must be included in the design, be sure to program them properly. Before you begin, explore these solutions and recommendations:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Include <a href="#card-distinct">distinct text</a> in your CTA's to make them more clear. For example, instead of "Learn More" use "Learn More about Accessibility". Apple does this on its own <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/card/apple-example.png">careers site</a>. Many designers and stakeholders do not like the additional space this takes up, but it really is the most effective way to prioritize usability and accessibility.</li>
        <li>Alternatively, linking the <a href="#card-link-heading">card heading</a> and incorporating affordances, such as arrows, is familiar to users and can effectively prompt action just as well as text can. By removing the "Learn More" text, we mitigate the risk of them being programmed incorrectly as hyperlinks.</li>
        <li>Use <a href="#card-visually-hidden">visually hidden</a> text techniques. However, this technique should not be used in CMS-authored content.</li>
        <!-- li>ARIA can also be used, but <em>sparingly</em> and only when all other options have been exhausted. Here also, this technique should not be used in client managed, CMS content.</li -->
        <li>If "Learn More" is a necessary part of the design, it can be implemented as a <a href="#card-faux">faux CTA</a>. Meaning, you can include the text, but do not mark it up as a hyperlink. It can even be hidden from assistive technology by using ARIA, as it really is superfluous. This technique may not be used in CMS-authored content.</li> 
    </ol>

    <p>Including a card interface can significantly improve users' comprehension of the information at hand. Here are some important things to consider when designing and developing them, especially where accessibility is concerned.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Avoid linking multiple regions of card content (image, title, summary). Doing so creates more "noise" for assistive technology users to have to listen to. This is why linking the card title only, is always preferred. See the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/card/#pseudo-element-trick">pseudo-element trick</a> to learn how to make entire card region clickable.</li>
        <li>If images are present, use alt text only when the image requires a description. <strong>The card title must never be used as alt text.</strong></li>
        <li>Make sure your heading levels are based on surrounding content. These tend to be <code>h3</code> or <code>h2</code>. Skipping of headings should be avoided.</li>
        <li>Always use a class on your card headings in event heading level needs to be changed.</li>
        <li>If a summary is not present, <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/card/#card-no-summary">a heading must not be used</a>. Be sure to reflect this in your programming or if a request is made to remove a card summary.</li>
        <li>Be mindful of focus states. Applying <code>:focus</code> to <code>li</code> or <code>div</code> will not work for keyboard users. Use <code>:focus-within</code> instead.</li>
    </ul>
