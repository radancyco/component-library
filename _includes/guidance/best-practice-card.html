<p>When designing card interfaces, it's essential to prioritize accessibility and usability. Below are key best practices and common pitfalls to avoid when structuring cards, especially for assistive technology users.</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Use distinct and descriptive CTA text - </strong> Instead of generic phrases like "Learn More," opt for <a href="#card-distinct">distinct</a> and contextually relevant links (e.g., "Learn More about Accessibility"). This improves clarity and usability, especially for screen reader users.</li>
    <li><strong>Consider linking only the card heading - </strong> This approach, combined with affordances such as arrows, provides a familiar interaction pattern while reducing the risk of incorrectly programmed hyperlinks.</li>
    <li><strong>Utilize visually hidden text where appropriate - </strong> <a href="#card-visually-hidden">Hidden text</a> techniques can enhance accessibility, but they should not be used in CMS-authored content, due to the high risk of breaking accessibility.</li>
    <li><strong>Use a "Faux CTA" if necessary - </strong> If "Learn More" must be included for design purposes, it can be <a href="#card-faux">visually present</a> but not marked up as a hyperlink. It can even be hidden from assistive technology using ARIA, as it is often redundant. However, this technique should not be used in CMS-authored content.</li>
    <li><strong>Do not overload hyperlinks with excessive content - </strong> Wrapping too much content, including alternative text, within a link can overwhelm assistive technology users. If the entire card needs to be clickable, use the <a href="#pseudo-element-trick">pseudo-element trick</a> to maintain a single link structure.</li>
    <li><strong>Provide appropriate alt text for images - </strong> Only use alt text if the image requires a description. The card title should never be repeated as alt text.</li>
    <li><strong>Use proper heading levels - </strong> Card headings should follow the surrounding content structure, typically these are <code>h3</code> or <code>h2</code>, and heading levels should never be skipped.</li>
    <li><strong>Apply a class to card headings - </strong> This allows flexibility if the heading level needs to be changed later or removed entirely.</li>
    <li><strong>Avoid headings in cards without summaries - </strong> If a card does <a href="#card-no-summary">not contain a summary</a>, a heading should not be used.</li>
    <li><strong>Ensure proper focus states - </strong> The <code>:focus</code> pseudo-class does not work on non-interactive element for keyboard users. Instead, use <code>:focus-within</code> if you need to highlight parent element when a link within the card recesives focus.</li>
    <li><strong>Avoid redundant or unnecessary links - </strong> If both the <a href="#card-duplicate">heading and CTA</a> link to the same URL, ensure they are correctly marked up to prevent confusion.</li>
    <li><strong>Provide semantic structure - </strong> <a href="#card-structural-context">Proper markup</a>, like a list of cards with nested headings and links, may not requre you to add visually hidden content (though it is never a bad idea to include it anyway).</li>
