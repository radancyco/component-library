    <h2 id="a11y-heading">Responsible Animation</h2>

    <p>Be mindful of the impact that animation can have on people with disabilities. Animation can be a distraction for some, make others ill, and dangerous for those subject to seizures. By sticking to the following guidelines, we can make our web experiences pleasant and safe for everybody!</p>

    <ol>    
        <li>Videos, CSS, gifs, or carousels that loop <strong>must</strong> include a <a href="/component-library/animation-toggle">pause button</a>. Third-party plugins, such as Slick, have their own <a href="https://accessible360.github.io/accessible-slick/#autoplay">implementation</a> of pause.</li>
        <li>Animations that occur when interacting with a web page are exempt from having a pause button if they do not last for more than <strong>5 seconds</strong>. However, developers should continue to honor user settings and include <code>prefers-reduced-motion</code> to reduce or stop animation <em>where needed</em>. See <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-reduced-motion">MDN</a> for more details about this useful media query.</li>
        <li>Animations that flash more than <strong>3 times per second</strong> are <strong>not allowed</strong> on our websites, as they may induce seizures. A pause button will be ineffective here. If you suspect that animation is dangerous, please bring this to the attention of the <a href="mailto:a11y@radancy.com">Accessibility Team</a>.</li>
    </ol>
