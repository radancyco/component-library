    <p><strong>Reminder:</strong> Do not confuse a tabbed interface with a horizontal accordion&mdash;they are not the same. The key difference lies in their behavior. If you expect content sections to <em>always</em> close when a tab button is pressed, then please use the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/accordion/">Accordion</a> component. However, a tabbed UI should have only a few tabs. If there are too many, then you should consider a horizontal accordion instead.</p>
