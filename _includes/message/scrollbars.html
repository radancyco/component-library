    <p><strong>Reminder:</strong> This component may include scrollbars, especially when resized. Scrollbar design and behavior can vary across operating systems and browsers, which is normal. If using <code>::-webkit-scrollbar</code>, note that some browsers may not support this and will default to non-prefixed properties, where look and behavior may differ. For accessibility, ensure sufficient color contrast of 3:1 and touch target of at least 44px by 44px.</p>
