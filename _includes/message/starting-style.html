    <p><strong>Experimental:</strong> Please note that this example uses the new <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@starting-style">@starting-style</a> at-rule and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition-behavior#allow-discrete">transition-behavior: allow-discrete;</a> to produce animation. This technique is supported in most major browsers. If you require specific animation in non-supporting browser, you will need to come up with a traditional implementation.</p>
