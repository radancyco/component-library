    <p><strong>Warning:</strong> This approach should be used sparingly. Try to avoid removing interactive components based on screen size, as it can disrupt usability. If a user zooms in and focuses on a button, they will lose focus when zooming out because the button or button visibility is removed, which can be disorienting.</p>
