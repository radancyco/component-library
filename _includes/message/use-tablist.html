    <p><strong>Reminder:</strong> Do not confuse a horizontal accordion with a tabbed interface&mdash;they are not the same. The key difference lies in their behavior. If you require a content section to <em>always</em> remain open and never be closed, then please use the <a href="/tablist/">TabList</a> component.</p>
