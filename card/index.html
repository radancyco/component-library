    note: 'Examine this markup closely and you will notice that we are using an element called <code>hgroup</code> to encapsulate the eyebrow and heading. This should be done instead of using multiple headings to markup alternative titles. See <a href="https://www.tpgi.com/subheadings-subtitles-alternative-titles-and-taglines-in-html/">Subheadings, subtitles, alternative titles and taglines in HTML</a> for more details about this useful element and best practice.'
