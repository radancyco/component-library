roadmap:

  - Behavior - Add Escape Key functionality to <a href="#horizontal-overlay">Overlay</a> example (High).
  - Behavior - Add back button support. Currently, the URL fragment changes, but not the content (High).
  - Behavior - Add video support for YouTube, Vimeo, and HTML5. Video needs to reset when accordion is closed. Delievery team to workaround for now (High).
  - Feature - Move the "Show All" feature from the <a href="../disclosure/">Disclosure</a> component to here (Low).
  - Feature - Reinstate callback functionality. While it is no longer needed in this component, it may still be useful to have (Medium).
  - Feature - Consider the possibility of introducing arrow key support. While optional, it might be a nice inclusion (Low).
