    html: .accordion
    note:

    desc: Specifies that each accordion should have its own close button. By default, no close buttons are provided. Should only be used with <code>data-overlay</code>.

  - name: data-disable-anchor
    html: .accordion
    note:

      - Boolean
      - Optional
    
    desc: Used to disable the anchor that appears in the address bar when a tab is clicked on. Do note that including an anchor can be useful for tracking and sharing specific content, so we should only remove when we have a good reason.

  - name: data-fixed-height
    html: .accordion
    note:

      - Boolean
      - Optional
    
    desc: Used to fix the panel content to a specific height. The height may be adusted in the CSS.

    html: .accordion
    note:

      - Boolean
      - Optional
    
    desc: Used to apply a default grid layout to the accordion. The grid may be adjusted in the CSS.

  - name: data-open
    html: .accordion__button
    note:

      - Boolean
      - Optional
    
    desc: Specifies which accordion panel should be open on page load. If not specified, no panels will be open by default. Only one accordion may be opened at a time.

    html: .accordion
    note:

      - Boolean

    note:

      - String
      - Mandatory
    
    desc: Each accordion button must have a unique ID with no spaces. The console will display an error if this requirement is not met. Allowing a developer to handle the ID, allows for custom anchoring.

classes:

  - name: .accordion	
    html: 

      - div
      - section
    
    note: Mandatory
    desc: Required on the parent element that wraps your content.
  
  - name: .accordion__button
    html: button

roadmap:

  - Add back button support. Currently, the url fragment changes, but not the content.
  - Add video support for YouTube, Vimeo, and HTML5. Video needs to reset when accordion is closed. Delievery team to workaround for now.
  - Move the "Show All" feature from the Disclosure module to here.
  - Reinstate callback functionality. While it is no longer needed in this component, it may still be useful to have.
  - Consider reinstating <code>role="group"</code>. However, it should not be excessive on <a href="#multi-expand">Multiple Expansions</a>, say if there are more than 6 accordion items.
  - Consider the possibility of introducing arrow key support. While optional, it might be nice inclusion.
