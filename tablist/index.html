attributes:

  - name: data-disable-anchor
    html: .tablist
    note:
  
      - Boolean
      - Optional

    desc: Used to disable the anchor that appears in the address bar when a tab is clicked on. Do note that including an anchor can be useful for tracking and sharing specific content, so we should only remove when we have a good reason.

  - name: data-scroll
    html: .tablist
    note:

      - Boolean
      - Optional

    desc: Used to change the list into a scroll in smaller viewport sizes. While scrolling is always an option, it should only be done sparingly. Allowing tabs to stack is always the better choice,

  - name: data-vertical
    html: .tablist
    note:

      - Boolean
      - Optional

    desc: Used to change the layout of the tabs from horizontal to vertical. The CSS for this layout is tied to <code>aria-orientation</code>, which does not have wide assisitve technology support yet.
