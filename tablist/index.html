      - Boolean
      - Optional

    desc: Used to disable the anchor that appears in the address bar when a tab is clicked on. Do note that including an anchor can be useful for tracking and sharing specific content, so we should only remove when we have a good reason.

    html: .tablist
    note:

      - Boolean
