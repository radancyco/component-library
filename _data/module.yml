        note: 'In this example, take note of the headings used to wrap the <code>button</code> elements, creating a more logical, interactive, and navigable structure for assistive technology users. Default list markup is also present to help convey the number of accordion items there are, and wrapping the accordion in a <code>section</code> element connected to the "My FAQ" heading via <code>aria-labelledby</code> creates a landmark region for the grouping. Together, these techniques improve the overall understanding of the component for users with certain disabilities, specifically blind and low vision users. Please watch the <a href="headings.mp4">demo</a> to see this behavior in action.'

In such cases, it is crucial to ensure that accessibility on larger screens is not compromised by leaving buttons accessible to assistive technologies. To see this solution in action, try pressing or tabbing to the headings in larger viewport sizes. As you'll notice, the headings are not interactive and all content that would normally be collapsed is revealed, which is exactly what we want. However, when you change the viewport to a smaller size, the component then becomes a traditional accordion. This kind of behavior can often be found in the footer of applications or website, where space is more limited on smaller screens."

        note: 'When incorporating a video, ensure that the title explicitly includes "(Video)" to aid assistive technology users, signaling their engagement with video content. If this content is not visually desired, you may use various techniques to <a href="https://www.scottohara.me/blog/2017/04/14/inclusively-hidden.html">hide it</a>, but still make it accessible to assistive technology. Additionally, always provide captions for videos, and when needed, ensure transcripts are available. In the design of the module, we are also offsetting the play button, which often obstructs the selected images in undesirable ways.'

        note: In this example, the heading serves as the primary link, with an arrow affordance to draw attention to it instead of using a text-based call to action like <a href="#learn-more">Learn More</a>. A CSS <a href="#pseudo-element-trick">pseudo-element trick</a> makes the entire card clickable, ensuring broad usability while maintaining a unique link in each card for better accessibility. 
        warning: This strategy can be used by developers but is not recommended for CMS-authored content.

      - name: "Card Link (Distinct CTA)"
        id: "card-distinct"
        group: Linking Strategies
        note: In this example, the heading does not need to be the primary link because each call to action (CTA) provides distinct and unique hypertext. 
        best-practice: This strategy can be used by developers and CMS authors. While designers may not embrace this strategy due to the length of the CTA, this may be the most universal, straightforward, and accessible way to handle CTAs across a wide range of situations.

      - name: "Card Link (Visually Hidden CTA)"
        id: "card-visually-hidden"
        note: In this example, the heading does not need to be the primary link because each call to action (CTA) provides unique hypertext. However, the distinct portions of the link are visually hidden to maintain a clean appearance while still providing contextual meaning for assistive technology users.
        warning: This strategy can be used by developers but is not recommended for CMS-authored content.
        group: Linking Strategies

      - name: "Card Link (Faux CTA)"
        id: "card-faux"
        note: In this example, the heading serves as the primary link, but the arrow affordance has been replaced with a text-based call to action (Learn More). This is often called a "Faux CTA" because it is not clickable and it is intentionally hidden from assistive technology. Like an arrow affordance, it is meant purely as a visual call to action. 
        warning: This strategy can be used by developers but is not recommended for CMS-authored content.
        group: Linking Strategies

      - name: "Card Link (Link Heading & CTA)"
        id: "card-duplicate"
        note: In this example, both the heading and the call to action point to the same URL, with the call to action effectively hidden from assistive technology and keyboard users via <code>aria-hidden="true"</code> and <code>tabindex="-1"</code>. While this strategy is uncommon, it is considered a more <a href="https://alistapart.com/article/material-honesty-on-the-web/">materially honest</a> technique compared to many commonly used methods of linking a card. If nothing else, it can serve as a practical solution for addressing adjacent duplicate links, which can be a problem for accessibility.
        group: Linking Strategies
        warning: This strategy can be used by developers but is not recommended for CMS-authored content.

      - name: "Card Link (Link Block)"
        id: "card-block"
        note: In this example, a hyperlink is placed around the image, heading, and content, making the entire region clickable. 
        warning: This method should be avoided unless the content output is known to not be excessive. Wrapping excessive amounts of content, including possible alternative text, within a hyperlink can overwhelm assistive technology users. This strategy, when deemed appropriate, can be used by developers but is not recommended for CMS-authored content.

      - name: "Card Link (Structural Context)"
        id: "card-structural-context"
        note:  In this example, the card interface uses list markup with nested images, headings and hyperlinks, ensuring clarity without the need for visually hidden text. This applies to cards with single or multiple links. While including visually hidden text is always recommended, content structure alone may provide sufficient context when hidden text is not possible or advisable. See WCAG <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H77">Technique H77</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/html/H81">Technique H81</a> for more information.
        group: Linking Strategies
        best-practice: This strategy can be used by developers, with visually hidden text as recommended, and CMS authors if visually hidden text is not included.
