      - name: "Interactive Headings (FAQ)"
        id: "headings"
        note: 'In this example, take note of the headings used to wrap the <code>button</code> elements, creating a more logical, interactive, and navigable structure for assistive technology users. Default list markup is also present to help convey the number of accordion items there are, and wrapping the accordion in a <code>section</code> element connected to the "My FAQ" heading via <code>aria-labelledby</code> creates a landmark region for the grouping. Together, these techniques improve the overall understanding of the component for users with certain disabilities, specifically blind and low vision users. Please watch the <a href="headings.mp4">demo</a> to see this behavior in action.'
        
      - name: "Multiple Open"
        id: "multiple-open"
        note: "Ideally, only one accordion section should be open at a time. However, there may be cases where allowing multiple sections to be open simultaneously is desirable, such as when a user wants to compare or search through the content."

        id: "toggle-all"

      - name: "Viewport Context"
        id: "viewport-context"
        note: "In some scenarios, we may only want the accordion to be present on smaller viewports. In such cases, it is crucial to ensure that accessibility on larger screens is not compromised by leaving buttons accessible to assistive technologies. To see this solution in action, try pressing or tabbing to the headings in larger viewport sizes. As you'll notice, the headings are not interactive and all content that would normally be collapsed is revealed, which is exactly what we want. However, when you change the viewport to a smaller size, the component then becomes a traditional accordion. This kind of behavior can often be found in the footer of applications or website, where space is more limited on smaller screens."

        note: 'Examine this markup closely and you will notice that we are using an element called <code>hgroup</code> to encapsulate the eyebrow and heading. This should be done instead of using multiple headings to markup alternative titles. See <a href="https://www.tpgi.com/subheadings-subtitles-alternative-titles-and-taglines-in-html/">Subheadings, subtitles, alternative titles and taglines in HTML</a> for more details about this useful element and best practice.'

      - name: "Card (Image, Faux CTA,  3x)"
        id: "card-faux-cta"
        note: As usual, our heading is the hyperlink, but we are also including an additional text CTA, which is not a hyperlink and never should be. Ideally, we should <a href="#learn-more">avoid using these kinds of CTAs</a> and look to visual cues to call attention to the action to be taken. Additionally, <code>aria-hidden="true"</code> could be included to hide this superfluous text.

        note: If multple links must be used, try your best to include visually hidden text to provide better context. If this cannot be done, context can be provided in how the interface is structured. In this example, the cards are an unordered list, with headings and nested lists of relevant links.

      - name: "Card (Image, No Summary, 3x)"
        id: "card-no-summary"
        warning: "Examine this markup closely and you will notice the absence of heading levels. This omission stems from the lack of a clear summary. Headings should exclusively introduce content; otherwise, they should not be used."

      - name: "Card (Image, Video, 3x)"

If this content is not visually desired, you may use various techniques to <a href="https://www.scottohara.me/blog/2017/04/14/inclusively-hidden.html">hide it</a>, but still make it accessible to assistive technology.
