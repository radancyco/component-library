  - item: "Pausing one animation will result in a pause for all site-wide animations utilizing this script. Any animations that are paused will maintain their paused state when you return to the site."
  - item: "The script utilizes <code>prefers-reduced-motion</code>. If a user disables system animations, video and CSS autoplay will be disabled as well. Additionally, phones in low power mode may automatically pause autoplaying videos to conserve battery life."
  - item: "While the <code>disableremoteplayback</code> attribute may not be recognized as valid HTML, the error can be safely disregarded."
  - item: "Please be aware that using multiple <code>source</code> elements is not currently supported when <code>data-media</code> is in use. We're planning to correct this in the near future."
