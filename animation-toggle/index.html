notes: 

  - item: Pausing one animation will pause all animations across the site that use this script.
  - item: Animations that are paused will continue to be so when returning to the site.
  - item: The script utilizes <code>prefers-reduced-motion</code>. When a user disables operating system animation, video or CSS will not autoplay.
  - item: Phones that are in low power mode may pause video that autoplays. This conserves battery life. Detection for this will be added soon.
  - item: The <code>disableremoteplayback</code> attribute is invalid in W3C validation. While not a standard attribute, the error can be ignored.
  - item: Multiple <code>source</code> elements are not supported when <code>data-media</code> is used. Support for this will be added soon.
  - item: Video should always be delivered as an optimized <code>mp4</code> or <code>webm</code>. The file size should be as small as possible without sacrificing quality, to reduce page weight.
  - item: Video should be no longer than <strong>15-30</strong> seconds in length. The shorter the video is, the less of an impact it will have on performance.
