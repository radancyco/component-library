components:

  - name: "Default Setup"
    id: "default-setup"

  - name: "Audio Description (Experimental)"
    id: "audio-description"
    note: "This is an experimental feature that will allow the video to include an audio description. A valid, self-produced <a href='demo.vtt'>VTT</a> file is required."

  - name: "Callback Example (After Effects)"
    id: "callback"
    codepenjs: "https://radancy.dev/component-library/animation-toggle/callback-lottie.js"
    customcss: "callback-custom"
    customjs: "callback-custom.js"

  - name: "CSS Animation"
    id: "css-animation"
    customcss: "css-animation"

  - name: "Custom Loop"
    id: "custom-loop"
    note: "The video will only loop one time. Once complete, it cannot be restarted."

  - name: "Hero Banner (Video)"
    id: "hero-banner"

  - name: "Kitchen Sink"

  - name: "Multiple Videos"
    id: "multiple-videos"
    customcss: "multiple-videos"

  - name: "No Pause Button"
    id: "no-pause-button"
    note: In some situations, it may be desirable to remove a pause button but still have animation benefit from cookie setting enabled in videos that do contain a pause button. This is not a feature that should be used lightly.

  - name: "Poster (Fallback Image)"
    id: "poster"
    note: "Pause the video and then refresh the page. The first frame is from 25 seconds in. Please note that when pressing play, video will resume from this point."

  - name: "Responsive (Media Queries)"
    id: "responsive"
    note: "Resize your browser window and refresh page. Loading alternatively sized and/or video formats to improve layout and performance is fully supported."

  - name: "SVG Animation"
    id: "svg-animation"
    customcss: "svg-animation"

  - name: "Transparent Video (Intersection Observer)"
    id: "transparent"
    customcss: "transparent"
    customjs: "transparent.js"
    note: This video utilizes an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API">Intersection Observer</a> triggered by a callback function. When positioned at the top of the page, it loads instantly; when lower, it plays as you scroll to it. This demo will only play once, requiring a page refresh for replay.

aria:

  - name: aria-label
    html: video
    note:
  
      - String
      - Optional
  
    desc: Used to pass custom label to <code>video</code> element. This will override the default label, which is "Background Animation".
  
  - name: aria-live
    html: .animation-toggle__track
    note: Conditional
    desc: Required on <code>.animation-toggle__track</code> when present and must contain a value of "polite".

attributes:

  - name: data-audio-description-button
    html: .animation-toggle
    note:

      - String
      - Optional

    desc: Used to pass custom label to <code>.animation-toggle__audio</code>. This will override the default label, which is "Audio Description".

  - name: data-callback
    html: .animation-toggle
    note:

      - String
      - Optional

    desc: Used to define a custom callback function to initiate when animation first loads and pause button is accessed. Particularly useful for handling third-party scripts. The callback accepts a single parameter called <code>thisButton</code> that you can use to target the button itself, if needed.
  
  - name: data-loop
    html: video
    note:

      - Number
      - Optional

    desc: Used to set the amount of times a video will loop. Please note that when a loop iteration is completed, a video cannot be restarted and the pause button will become disabled.

  - name: data-pause-button
    html: .animation-toggle
    note:

      - String
      - Optional

    desc: Used to pass custom label to <code>.animation-toggle__pause</code>. This will override the default label, which is "Pause Animation".

  - name: data-pause-remove
    html: .animation-toggle
    note:

      - Boolean
      - Optional

    desc: Used to remove a pause button from animation. This attribute should only be used in certain configurations. For example, short, non-looping animations. 

  - name: data-poster
    html: video
    note:

      - Number
      - Optional

    desc: Used to indicate at which point video will load when paused. Accepts any valid time increment. Video will start from this point when play is enabled.

classes:

  - name: .animation-enabled
    html: body
    note: Component
    desc: Applied on page load. Page animations will only run when this class is present. Removing it pauses animation. If you are leveraging this class in your CSS or scripting, then there is no need to use <code>prefers-reduced-motion</code>.

  - name: .animation-toggle	
    html: 

      - div
      - section

    note: Mandatory
    desc: Required on the parent element that wraps your animation and content.

  - name: .animation-toggle__audio
    html: button
    note: Component
    desc: Used on all audio description buttons.

  - name: .animation-toggle__backdrop
    html: .animation-toggle
    note: Optional
    desc: Append to <code>.animation-toggle</code> class. This will allow video to animate in on page load and for background shading to display when video is paused. Often used on hero banner and meant to improve contrast of foreground text.
  
  - name: .animation-toggle__controls
    html: div
    note: Component
    desc: Used to contain pause and audio description buttons.

  - name: .animation-toggle__pause
    html: button
    note: Component
    desc: Used on all pause buttons. This may never be hidden and is an integral part of the component.

  - name: .animation-toggle__track
    html: div
    note: Optional
    desc: Used on single <code>div</code> element that is a child of <code>.animation-toggle</code>. The <code>aria-live</code> attribute is required on this element when used.
    
  - name: .animation-toggle__video
    html: video
    note: Mandatory
    desc: Required on <code>video</code> element that is a child of <code>.animation-toggle</code>. Multiple videos may be used if desired.

cookies:

notes: 

  - "<b>Behavior:</b> Pausing one animation will result in a pause for all site-wide animations utilizing this script. Any animations that are paused will maintain their paused state when user returns to the site."
  - "<b>Behavior:</b> The script utilizes <code>prefers-reduced-motion</code>. If a user disables system animations, all animations will honor this setting." 
  - "<b>Behavior:</b> When no cookie is set and reduce animation is enabled, the animation stops."
  - "<b>Behavior:</b> When no cookie is set and reduce animation is not enabled, the animation plays."
  - "<b>Behavior:</b> When cookie is set to false (not paused) and reduce animation is enabled, OS setting take precedent and cookie is set to true (paused)."
  - "<b>Issue:</b> When cookie is set to true (paused) and reduce animation is disabled, cookie is not set to false (not paused). Page needs to be refreshed. This may not be an issue, but to work, we may need another condition to hook into here."
  - "<b>Behavior:</b> When reduce animation is not enabled, cookie settings take precedent."
  - "<b>Roadmap:</b> When reduce animation is enabled, it would be great if local page settings could override OS setting."
  - "<b>Behavior:</b> Phones in low power mode may automatically pause auto-playing videos to conserve battery life."
  - "<b>Testing:</b> While the <code>disableremoteplayback</code> attribute may not be recognized as valid HTML, the error can be safely disregarded."
  - "<b>Roadmap:</b> Revisit <code>data-callback</code> and see if it makes sense to apply callback function to all animations if <code>data-callback</code> present on page at all. Right now, there is an animation disconnect between those that have the attribute and those that do not. Currently, we manually add the callback to all other page animations."
  - "<b>Roadmap:</b> Include a reload button to enable playback of videos that loop only once, allowing users to replay them if desired."
  - "<b>Roadmap:</b> If <code>data-pause-remove</code> is used, override it temporarily to include play button, so that video does not obscure content. Especially true when transparent video is used."
