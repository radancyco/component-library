notes: 

  - "When integrating banners for use in content page settings, the default code in the site theme also includes the structure mentioned above to leverage page-level items."
  - "If you're incorporating banners within sections or modules, follow a two-part approach. In <strong>Partial 1</strong>, place images within a <code>picture</code> element, and in <strong>Partial 2</strong>, embed your HTML content. For guidance on the proper implementation of headings in hero banners, please refer to <a href='#a11y-hero-headings'>Accessibility: Hero Banner Headings</a>."
  - "In this demo, an optional constraint has been set with a maximum width of 1400px horizontally."
  - "It's worth noting that while class names are tailored for left-to-right languages, this is done to accommodate developers and authors who read from left to right. The CSS utilizes <a href='https://adrianroselli.com/2019/11/css-logical-properties.html'>CSS Logical Properties</a> to ensure proper rendering in both left-to-right and right-to-left languages."
