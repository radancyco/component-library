    note: 

      - Boolean
      - Optional

    desc: By default, scolling is present on smaller screens but not on larger ones. This is used as hook in the CSS to bypass the default behavior, allowing a scroll to be present across all viewport sizes. 

classes:

  - name: .horizontal-scroll
    html: 
  
      - div
      - section
  
    note: Mandatory
    desc: Used on the parent element that wraps your content.

  - name: .horizontal-scroll__card

        - article
        - div
        - li
        - section

    note: Recommended
    desc: Used for each individual content container. Recommended, but if custom CSS is desired you may create your own.

  - name: .horizontal-scroll__heading
    html: 
  
      - h2
      - h3
      - h4
      - h5
      - h6 
  
    note: Recommended
    desc: Used for each individual content heading. Ideally, you'll want each heading to contain your hyperlink, so that the purpose of each link can be better understood by assistive technologies. Recommended, but if custom HTML and CSS is desired you may create your own.

notes: 

  - Behavior - If the script fails to load, the component will still be operable via keyboard, though there will be a double tabstop in cases where interactive elements like <code>a</code> and <code>button</code> are present.
